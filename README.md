Hello, I am an Mechanical Engineering Student and am trying to work on
different projects throughout my years to learn more about coding.

Currently this is a 2d simple beam solver in which it takes up to 5 forces
and 3 supports along a simple beam to find unknown forces along those different
support types. I have plans to work on 3d models and add more overall projects.
